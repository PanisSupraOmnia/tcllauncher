ChangeLog

    * Add aclocal.m4 to create a rule for finding the path to dtplite and
      modify configure.in to use that rule.

    * Alter Makefile.in to have rules for building the tcllauncher.n
      manpage using dtplite based on the tcllauncher.man Tcl doctools file.

2009-06-11 karl
    * Deploy pidfile_* and daemonize functions.

    * Document pidfile functions.

    * Version bump to 1.1

    * Builds cleanly on Debian.  Added README.Debin with configure instructions.

2008-11-18 karl
    * Upgrade to Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA) 3.7

    * Create a global variable, launchdir, containing the directory that
      the main.tcl is being run out of, if the path to the executable
      is .../bin/programName, else set that variable to "."  This provides
      a way for programs to find other files they installed alongside
      their main.tcl.

    * When invoked as a shell, [info nameofexecutable] returns nothing.

      Detect that condition and, if so, use the SHELL environment variable
      to form the basis of what we do.  For instance, if the shell is 
      /usr/local/bin/farsh, we'll run /usr/local/lib/farsh/main.tcl.

2007-12-03 karl
    * Make sure tcllauncher gets installed into the bin directory.

2007-11-24 karl
    * When allocating memory to fiddle command line arguments before
      invoking Tcl_Main, use malloc instead of ckalloc because whatever
      ckalloc needs hasn't necessarily been initialized yet.

    * Using $(COMPILE) instead of $(CC) for compiling the main routine
      makes it work on FreeBSD as well as the Mac.

2007-10-19 karl
    * Changes to tcllauncher.tcl make it actually do what it's supposed
      to do.
